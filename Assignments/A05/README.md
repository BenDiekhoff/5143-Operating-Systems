- In this assignment you will test the efficacy of various scheduling algorithms.  You will implement the following: 
  - First Come First Serve(FCFS) Scheduling
  - Shortest-Job-First(SJF) Scheduling
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
  - Multilevel Queue Scheduling
  - Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling

----

- **First Come First Serve(FCFS) Scheduling**
    - First Come First Serve, is just like FIFO(First in First out) Queue data structure, where the data element which is added to the queue first, is the one who leaves the queue first.
-  **Shortest-Job-First(SJF) Scheduling**
    - Shortest Job First scheduling works on the process with the shortest burst time or duration first.
- **Priority Scheduling**
    - Priority is assigned for each process.
    - Process with highest priority is executed first and so on.
    - Processes with same priority are executed in FCFS manner.
- **Round Robin(RR) Scheduling**
    - A fixed time is allotted to each process, called quantum, for execution.
- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
  - TBD
- **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**
  - TBD
